Revision history for Perl extension Catalyst::Plugin::PageCache

0.20    2008-10-02 00:15:00
        - Config option 'cache_headers' to cache HTTP headers.  This is needed
          if operating behind edge caches such as Akamai. (Chris Alef)
        - Config option 'busy_lock' borrowed from Mason, avoids the "dog-pile"
          effect where many concurrent requests can generate and cache the same
          page.  See the documentation for details.
        - The ability to call clear_cached_page can be disabled to improve
          performance (a cache index will not be created/updated).
        
0.19    2008-08-22 13:00:00
        - Change config namespace to $c->config->{'Plugin::PageCache'}, old
          namespace will still continue to work.
        - key_maker method, allows custom cache keys to be used. (Martin Ellison)

0.18    2008-04-25 11:30:00

0.16    2007-07-24 10:30:00

        - Switched to Module::Install.

        - Added ability to pass in a DateTime object to expire at a specific
          time (moseley)
        - Added ability to pass in an options list to set the cache expires
          time separately from the expires time sent to client. (moseley)
        - Test If-Modified-Since headers on request that loads the page cache.
          Was only testing when returning a page already in the page cache.
          (moseley)
        - Now sends Expires and Cache-Control headers on 304 to reset client cache.

        - Fixed bug in cache key generation that ignored duplicate key names.
        - Fixed bug where clear_cached_page called with a regex did not
          properly remove the page from cache.
        - Fixed bug where cache metadata was not set properly if
          content-type or content-encoding was missing.

0.09    2005-06-27 11:25:00
        - Removed dependence on HTTP::Date.
        - Make sure the same cache key checked during the dispatch phase
          is used during the finalize phase.  This avoids problems if the
          user adds or deletes request parameters.

        - Debug is now enabled by default if in Catalyst -Debug mode.
